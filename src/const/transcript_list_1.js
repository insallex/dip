    'Ravi: Hello, and welcome to LearnEnglish elementary podcast number one. My name’s Ravi…\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: … and I’m Tess. We’re your presenters and we’ve got lots of things for you to listen to today, but before we start, I think we should introduce ourselves. Ravi?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ravi: OK … erm … I’m Ravi.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: Or, I tell you what, I’ll introduce you and you can introduce me. How about that?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ravi: Well, OK then. Erm, this is Tess. She’s from London. She’s … how old are you?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: None of your business, Ravi!\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ravi: And she loves dancing and riding her mountain bike. OK?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: OK. And this is Ravi. He comes from Manchester. He’s 23. Oh … aren’t you?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ravi: Oh yes.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: He likes football, and … he’s a great cook.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ravi: Thanks! And there’s one more person for you to meet. I’d like to introduce our producer, Gordon. Say hello to everyone Gordon!\n' +

    'Tess: Good! We’ll speak to Gordon again later in the show but now it’s time to get on with our programme. We’ve got an excellent show for you today, and let’s start with our first section, called ‘I’d like to meet’. We ask people a simple question – which famous person, dead or alive would you like to meet? And of course, we ask them to explain why. Our guest today on ‘I’d like to meet’ is Zara Heller from Bristol. Hello Zara and welcome to the show.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Zara: Hello.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ravi: Hi Zara.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: And what do you do Zara?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Zara: I’m a student, I’m in my last year at school, I’m 16.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: Right. Now let’s ask the question. So Zara, which famous person, dead or alive would you like to meet?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Zara: I’d like to meet Angelina Jolie.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ravi: Angelina Jolie. Great - good choice! Tell us a bit about her.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Zara: She’s an American film actress, she was in ‘Tomb Raider’, and she’s an ambassador for the United Nations too.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: And why did you choose her to talk about today?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Zara: Well, because I really admire her. She’s a famous film star with a lot of money and a famous celebrity film star husband, but she really cares about helping people and she uses her money and her fame to help children and people who are very poor or have a difficult life. I saw a film about her on MTV the music channel – it was a video diary of her visiting Africa and talking about how to stop poverty, and they were really simple things, and I thought it was really cool because MTV doesn’t usually show programmes like that, it’s usually just music videos and things, but because she’s famous and beautiful then people want to see her so she can get a lot of attention for the things that she wants to change.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: Do you like her films? Do you think she’s a good actress?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Zara: Yes I do. I don’t think she’s a great actress, but she’s a good actress, and she’s so beautiful that you just want to look at her all the time.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ravi: Yeah.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Zara: I think she’s one of the most beautiful women in the world. I love watching her, I love all her films.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ravi: And what would you like to talk to her about Zara?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Zara: I’d like to talk about her trips to different places all around the world, and about Hollywood, and her family and about what people like me can do to help poor children.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: Well thank you very much Zara. That was really interesting. Personally, I’d like to talk to her about her husband, Brad Pitt. I think he’s gorgeous.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ravi: OK Tess, calm down. Erm, for all of you listening, we’d like to hear from you. Which famous person, dead or alive, would you like to meet? And why? Email us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org, that’s learnenglishpodcast - all one word – AT - britishcouncil – all one word DOT org, that’s o-r-g.

    'Tess: OK. Now it’s quiz time. Every week we’ll have a little quiz to get you thinking. This week it’s the ten second quiz. It’s very easy. We give you a topic and you give as many answers as you can - in 10 seconds. Our two players today are Daniel – Daniel’s 16 and comes from London. Hello Daniel.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Daniel: Hi\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: And Alice – Alice is also 16 and she comes from Liverpool. Hi Alice.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Alice: Hello\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: Do you both know what to do? OK. We give you a topic, and you have to write down all the words you can think of. For example, we say ‘bathroom’, and you write a list, bath, soap, shampoo, and so on. As quick as you can. Got the idea?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Alice: Yeah\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: Good. Okay. Let’s play. You’ve got ten seconds to write down … things you can find in a kitchen. OK? So, for example you could say ‘microwave oven’. OK? Things you can find in a kitchen. Go! (sound of clock ticking) OK, Daniel. How many?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Daniel: Erm, five, Tess.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: How about you, Alice?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Alice: Erm, seven, I think.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: OK, let’s hear your seven words, Alice. Things you find in a kitchen.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Alice: Erm, fridge. Cooker. Pans. Plates. Knife, fork, spoon.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: That’s seven. Well done, Alice. How many did you get, Ravi?\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ravi: Oh, the clock makes me nervous – I can’t think when the clock’s ticking like that. Maybe the question next week will be about football.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tess: Thanks Daniel, thanks Alice. And if any of you listening have a good game we can play in quiz time, write to us and let us know. The address is learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. We’d love to hear your ideas for games we can play. What’s next, Ravi?'
